In General need to think about error checking.

realized.rs
- Proceeds always on the left
- Does quantity need to be on both sides?  limit to 1
- check that realizedcompact from realized has same date

holding.rs
- refactor add - has duplication in function -- maybe split it up a bit more, has too much responsibility
// TODO: Holding Summary (sum all quantity and basis and price per unit added?)
// TODO: Allow LIFO vs FIFO
// TODO: is it possible to add lot selection?  how would this be defined
// - Remove and Inventory change are in the correct direction

unrealized.rs
- UR inventory From<&[URealized]> need to check that all volume is in the same direction
